# 🐇RabbiTeamLauncher🐇

Simple minecraft launcher for all kinds of modpacks. This launcher has very familiar looking of old native minecraft launcher that is now replaced with Microsoft one. It ~~has~~ ***will have*** all the features you need for developing ultimately custom modpack:

✅ Custom JVM Arguments predefined for a modpack

✅ Possibility to use custom libraries besides standard ones

✅ You can even use custom libraries that replace the standard ones

✅ Optional "Remote-Mods" feature that allows you to drastically decrease modpack size on cloud (by defining their names and versions in modpack.json)

✅ Compatibility with most custom launcher platforms (ATLauncher, Curse Launcher, FTBLauncher ...)

✅ AutoUpdate modpacks, optional of course

## More Information
As stated above, this project is not yet done, is still in beta and has lots of issues which I don't know about, so testing is highly appreciated.

**TO-DO**
